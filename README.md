ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights:

Picture this: You have the power to control your favorite web applications with a mere wave of your hand. Our Code, fueled by the incredible MediaPipe library for hand tracking and OpenCV for webcam access, brings this remarkable experience to life.

In summary, our code unveils a simple yet enchanting hand gesture recognition system, putting you in control of opening specific web applications by extending different numbers of fingers.

This project is a testament to the boundless possibilities when technology meets human interaction. It showcases how innovation can turn everyday tasks into intuitive and delightful experiences.
